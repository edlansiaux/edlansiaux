% Abstract
\chapter*{Abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}

\noindent\textbf{Background:} Hospital emergency departments face chronic overcrowding exacerbated by triage errors (10--15\,\% undertriage, 20--30\,\% overtriage). Artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a promising solution, but its evaluation remains fragmented, focused on isolated predictive metrics rather than holistic system impact.

\noindent\textbf{Objective:} To develop, evaluate, and compare three AI architectures (NLP, LLM, JEPA) for emergency triage through (1)~a retrospective proof-of-concept on real clinical data and (2)~a prospective multimodal simulation integrating clinical, organizational, economic, and technical criteria.

\noindent\textbf{Methods:} The proof-of-concept study (TIAEU) retrospectively analyzed 657 patients from CHU Lille (June--December 2024) with complete audio-recorded triage interviews and structured clinical data. Three AI models---TRIAGEMASTER (NLP/Doc2Vec+MLP), URGENTIAPARSE (LLM/FlauBERT+XGBoost), and EMERGINET (JEPA/VICReg)---were evaluated against a senior clinician consensus gold standard. The simulation framework extends this evaluation using a hybrid DES-MAS architecture enriched with digital twins, calibrated on 459,259 anonymized patient records (2018--2023), with systemic modeling via SysML.

\noindent\textbf{Results:} In the proof-of-concept, URGENTIAPARSE achieved the best performance (composite Z-score~2.514; F1-micro~0.900; AUC-ROC~0.879; weighted $\kappa$~0.800), outperforming EMERGINET (0.438; 0.731; 0.686), TRIAGEMASTER ($-$3.511; 0.618; 0.642), and nurse triage ($-$4.343; 0.303; 0.776). The simulation framework targets 25\,\% reduction in waiting times, 20\,\% reduction in inappropriate hospitalizations, and 15\,\% reduction in redundant examinations.

\noindent\textbf{Conclusions:} The LLM-based architecture demonstrated the highest accuracy for triage prediction. However, severe overfitting, selection bias (0.9\,\% inclusion), and monocentric design necessitate extensive further validation. The proposed simulation framework provides a comprehensive pre-clinical evaluation methodology to bridge the gap between proof-of-concept and clinical deployment.

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}

Emergency departments (EDs) constitute the critical entry point of healthcare systems worldwide. In France alone, EDs register over 20 million visits annually \cite{DREES2023}. The initial triage process, standardized through the FRENCH scale (\textit{French Emergency Nurses Classification in Hospital}), determines care prioritization and shapes the entire patient pathway. However, this decision-making process faces compounding challenges: inter-operator variability reaching 25--40\,\% \cite{Farrohknia2011, Parenti2014}, undertriage rates of 10--15\,\% with significant correlation to preventable mortality ($p < 0.001$) \cite{Ebrahimi2015}, and overtriage rates of 20--30\,\% contributing to resource misallocation \cite{Christ2010}. These errors propagate through the system, generating bottlenecks and extending waiting times---already at a median of 4\,h\,30---for all patients \cite{Boisguerin2017}.

Artificial intelligence has demonstrated potential for improving triage accuracy, with reported AUC-ROC values ranging from 0.75 to 0.92 across various architectures \cite{Levin2018, Klang2020}. However, the literature reveals critical gaps: evaluations remain focused on isolated predictive metrics without accounting for operational constraints; validations on static historical data fail to capture dynamic system interactions; medico-economic impact analyses are scarce; and the translational pathway from retrospective validation to prospective deployment remains poorly documented \cite{Wiens2019, Topol2019, Keane2018}.

This dissertation addresses these gaps through a two-pronged approach. First, a \textbf{retrospective proof-of-concept study} (TIAEU---\textit{Triage Intelligent \`A l'Entr\'ee des Urgences}) develops and comparatively evaluates three AI architectures for triage prediction using real nurse-patient interaction data from CHU Lille \cite{Lansiaux2025bdcat, Lansiaux2025jmir}. Second, a \textbf{prospective simulation framework} (EIMLIA-TEU) extends this evaluation through a hybrid discrete event simulation and multi-agent system, enriched with digital twins and formalized via SysML modeling, to assess multidimensional performance under realistic operational conditions.

The dissertation is organized as follows: Chapter~\ref{chap:context} presents the clinical, organizational, and economic context; Chapter~\ref{chap:stateoftheart} reviews the state of the art; Chapter~\ref{chap:methods} details the methodology for both the proof-of-concept and the simulation framework; Chapter~\ref{chap:solution} presents the proposed solution architecture; Chapter~\ref{chap:results} reports the experimental results from the proof-of-concept study; Chapter~\ref{chap:discussion} discusses the findings and their implications; and Chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion} concludes with perspectives for future work.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% CHAPTER 2: CONTEXT AND PROBLEM STATEMENT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\chapter{Context and Problem Statement}
\label{chap:context}

\section{Clinical Challenges of Emergency Triage}

The FRENCH triage scale classifies patients into six levels of urgency (1~=~immediate life-threatening to 6~=~non-urgent, with a 3A/3B distinction for invasive/non-invasive procedures). Despite standardization efforts, inter-operator variability remains a documented challenge in international literature \cite{Farrohknia2011, Parenti2014}. This variability generates two types of errors with distinct consequences.

\textbf{Undertriage} (10--15\,\% of cases) assigns an insufficient priority level, exposing patients to a loss of chance for life-threatening emergencies. Multiple factors contribute to this variability: heterogeneity in triage nurse experience, cognitive overload during peak flow periods, atypical presentations of severe pathologies, and inherent cognitive biases under time pressure \cite{Croskerry2009}.

\textbf{Overtriage} (20--30\,\% of cases) assigns an excessive priority level, contributing to congestion of priority care pathways and overconsumption of critical resources \cite{Christ2010}. The cascading effect of a single triage error propagates over several hours, potentially affecting dozens of secondary patients through queuing theory mechanisms \cite{Gross2008}.

\section{Organizational Challenges}

Chronic ED overcrowding manifests through a median waiting time of 4\,h\,30 and a congestion rate reaching 90\,\% of capacity during peak periods \cite{Boisguerin2017}. This results from a structural mismatch between incoming patient flows and care capacity. Triage errors amplify this systemic tension by directing patients toward inappropriate pathways, generating bottlenecks and extending delays across the entire waiting queue.

\section{Economic Challenges}

The national cost of ED visits exceeds 3~billion euros annually according to ATIH \cite{ATIH2025}. An estimated 15--20\,\% is attributable to inappropriate hospitalizations and redundant examinations following triage errors. Beyond direct costs, triage errors generate considerable hidden costs: extended sick leave, avoidable complications requiring expensive treatments, medico-legal disputes, and institutional reputation damage \cite{Richardson2006}.

\section{The Promise and Limitations of AI-Assisted Triage}

AI applied to triage has shown potential across several international studies. Three technological families stand out by their respective characteristics.

\textbf{Natural Language Processing (NLP)} models based on transformer architectures enable automated extraction of critical symptoms from nursing verbatims, with F1 precision of 0.60--0.85 depending on training corpora \cite{Mikolov2013, Devlin2019}. Distributed vector representations of documents (Doc2Vec) capture symptomatic semantics but remain sensitive to spelling errors (20--30\,\% of verbatims) and non-standardized abbreviations \cite{Le2014}.

\textbf{Large Language Models (LLMs)} such as GPT-4, Claude, and FlauBERT for French offer contextual understanding of complex clinical situations, integrating comorbidities and patient history, with AUC-ROC up to 0.88 on certain cohorts \cite{Chrusciel2021, LeH2020}. However, the risk of hallucinations requires robust clinical safeguards \cite{Ji2023}.

\textbf{Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA)}, inspired by LeCun's work \cite{LeCun2022}, jointly encode textual data and physiological time series to predict state deterioration. The VICReg loss function ensures stability superior to classical LSTMs \cite{Bardes2022, Yu2019}.

Despite these advances, four major gaps persist in the literature: fragmented evaluation focused on isolated metrics, absence of ecologically valid simulation, underestimation of hidden costs, and poor documentation of the translational pathway from research to clinical practice \cite{Wiens2019, Topol2019, Keane2018}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% CHAPTER 3: STATE OF THE ART
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\chapter{State of the Art and Positioning}
\label{chap:stateoftheart}

\section{Healthcare Simulation: Paradigms and Evolutions}

Simulation has become a major tool for capacity planning and care pathway optimization. Systematic reviews by Brailsford et al.\ \cite{Brailsford2009} and Aboueljinane et al.\ \cite{Aboueljinane2013} catalog over 250 studies applying simulation to EDs.

\subsection{Discrete Event Simulation (DES)}

DES models the system as a sequence of time-stamped events where each patient consumes resources according to a standardized stochastic process. Implemented using SimPy, FlexSim, or Mesa, it enables flow and capacity optimization with controlled computational complexity.

\begin{definition}[Discrete Event Simulation]
Let $\mathcal{S} = (E, T, R, Q)$ be a simulation system where $E = \{e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n\}$ is the event set, $T : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ is the timestamping function, $R = \{r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_m\}$ is the resource set, and $Q : R \times \mathbb{R}^+ \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ is the queue function.
\end{definition}

Lim et al.\ \cite{Lim2013} demonstrate that a well-calibrated DES predicts waiting times with a relative error below 10\,\%, enabling robust dimensioning decisions.

\subsection{Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)}

MAS model actors (patients, caregivers, equipment) as autonomous agents with stochastic behaviors, capturing emergent interactions and individual decisions \cite{Wang2009, Stainsby2009}. This granularity enables identification of optimizations invisible to macroscopic approaches.

\begin{definition}[Agent in a Healthcare System]
An agent $a_i$ is defined by the tuple $(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{P}, \mathcal{B}, \mathcal{I})$ where $\mathcal{A}$ denotes attributes (type, state, position), $\mathcal{P}$ denotes environmental perceptions, $\mathcal{B}$ denotes possible behaviors, and $\mathcal{I}$ denotes interaction rules with other agents.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Hybrid DES-MAS Approaches}

Moyaux et al.\ \cite{Moyaux2023} and Liu et al.\ \cite{Liu2025} propose mixed architectures exploiting the strengths of both paradigms: DES for standardized processes, MAS for adaptive behaviors. This approach reduces computation times by 40\,\% versus pure MAS while maintaining 95\,\% fidelity to real observations.

\section{Process Mining and Digital Twins}

Process mining automatically extracts process models from system logs, revealing discrepancies between theoretical and actual processes. Applied to EDs by Le~Lay et al.\ \cite{LeLay2024} during the COVID-19 pandemic, it enabled dynamic bed sizing with 95\,\% accuracy. The combination of process mining, digital twins, and data-driven simulation represents the state of the art for complex healthcare system modeling \cite{Lugaresi2021, vanHulzen2022, Schlecht2024}.

\begin{definition}[Digital Twin of an ED]
A digital twin $\mathcal{D}$ of an ED is a four-dimensional representation: $\mathcal{D} = (\mathcal{D}_S, \mathcal{D}_B, \mathcal{D}_T, \mathcal{D}_C)$ where $\mathcal{D}_S$ is the structural twin (physical topology), $\mathcal{D}_B$ is the behavioral twin (decision models), $\mathcal{D}_T$ is the temporal twin (arrival patterns), and $\mathcal{D}_C$ is the technical twin (computational load).
\end{definition}

\section{AI for Emergency Triage: Performance Overview}

Table~\ref{tab:lit_comparison} synthesizes published performances for different AI architectures applied to triage. The systematic review by Mohamed et al.\ \cite{Mohamed2024} including 17 studies concludes that machine learning methods are superior to conventional severity scores for triage determination, with boosting models showing a slight advantage.

\begin{table}[H]

FRENCH scale (nurses) & 0.83--0.86 & --- & --- & \cite{Taboulet2009, Taboulet2019} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Systemic Modeling with SysML}

The integration of SysML for evaluating AI systems in healthcare coupled with DES remains a critical gap in the literature \cite{Hossain2023}. SysML, standardized by the OMG for complex socio-technical system specification \cite{OMG2024}, has been validated for healthcare applications by Batarseh et al.\ \cite{Batarseh2013} and Hossain et al.\ \cite{Hossain2023}, demonstrating its capacity to unify communication among heterogeneous stakeholders, formalize traceable requirements and constraints, and identify emergent interactions in complex systems.

\section{Positioning and Identified Gaps}

This study addresses three major gaps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Absence of multidimensional evaluation:} No existing study simultaneously compares clinical performance, economic impact, and technical reliability under realistic conditions.
    
    \item \textbf{Underestimation of operational constraints:} Static data validations ignore latency, availability, and behavior under degraded conditions.
    
    \item \textbf{Lack of systemic formalization:} The use of SysML to model AI-healthcare system integration remains underexploited in the medical domain.
\end{enumerate}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% CHAPTER 4: METHODS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\chapter{Methods}
\label{chap:methods}

This study comprises two complementary components: (1)~a retrospective proof-of-concept study developing and evaluating three AI models on real clinical data, and (2)~a prospective simulation framework for multidimensional pre-clinical evaluation.

\section{Part 1: Proof-of-Concept Study (TIAEU)}

\subsection{Study Design and Ethical Compliance}

This retrospective, observational study was conducted at the Adult Emergency Department of CHU Lille, France, from June~1 to December~31, 2024. The study received CESREES approval, Health Data Hub filing (project number 18605502), and CNIL MR-004 compliance, following TRIPOD-AI guidelines \cite{Lansiaux2025bdcat, Lansiaux2025jmir}.

\subsection{Population and Inclusion Criteria}

The study included adult patients ($\geq 18$ years) evaluated in the Lille CHU ED with complete structured clinical data and recorded nurse-patient audio interviews. Exclusions applied to minors, legally protected adults, patients who declined data use ($n=2$), and cases with incomplete recordings, corrupted files, or failed transcription quality checks ($n=22$).

Of 73,236 ED visits during the inclusion period, 681 triage nurse interviews were recorded and transcribed. After excluding 24 cases, 657 patients (0.90\,\%) met the inclusion criteria, split 80:20 into training ($n=526$) and validation ($n=131$) sets with stratification by triage level.

\subsection{Data Acquisition and Preprocessing}

Structured clinical data were extracted from the ResUrgences\textsuperscript{\textregistered} ED management software (version 2024.1.148), including age, sex, vital signs, FRENCH scale assignment, and GEMSA scale. Nurse-patient triage interviews were audio-recorded, manually transcribed, verified by independent reviewers, anonymized, and securely stored.

\subsection{Gold Standard Construction}

A gold standard triage label was established through independent review by senior emergency physicians (minimum 5~years post-residency experience), blinded to original nurse triage assignment, all AI model outputs, and patient outcomes. Initial inter-rater agreement was substantial (Fleiss $\kappa = 0.72$, 95\,\% CI 0.68--0.76). Disagreements (23.5\,\% of cases) were resolved by structured consensus discussion. A sensitivity analysis excluding cases with nurse-standard discrepancies $\geq 1$ level ($n=47$) yielded similar model performance rankings.

\subsection{Model Architectures}

Three AI models were developed, each representing a major class of current machine learning techniques. All models were implemented in Python~3.9 with PyTorch~1.12 and scikit-learn~1.1, trained on NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

\subsubsection{TRIAGEMASTER (NLP)}

This model used Doc2Vec paragraph vector embeddings (distributed memory model; vector dimension=100, window=5, min\_count=2, 40 epochs) to represent free-text input, concatenated with z-score normalized numerical features. The architecture consisted of a three-layer feedforward neural network (input$\rightarrow$128$\rightarrow$64$\rightarrow$6 output classes) with ReLU activations, dropout ($p=0.3$), batch normalization, and L2 weight penalty ($\lambda = 1 \times 10^{-5}$). Optimization used the Adam optimizer (learning rate~0.001, batch size~32). Inference latency averaged 47\,ms per patient.

\subsubsection{URGENTIAPARSE (LLM)}

Built upon FlauBERT (flaubert-base-cased, 137M parameters) \cite{LeH2020}, this architecture fine-tuned contextual embeddings from patient complaints over 5 epochs (learning rate $2 \times 10^{-5}$), then extracted the [CLS] token embedding (768~dimensions). These were concatenated with normalized structured variables and fed into an XGBoost classifier (n\_estimators=200, max\_depth=6, learning\_rate=0.1). Feature importance was derived via SHAP values \cite{Lundberg2017}, providing transparent model behavior. Inference latency averaged 312\,ms per patient.

\subsubsection{EMERGINET (JEPA)}

This Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture encoded textual and structured inputs into a shared latent space (dimension=256) through dual encoders: a text encoder (FlauBERT base + 2-layer bidirectional LSTM, hidden size~128) and a structured encoder (3-layer MLP with sizes [64, 128, 256]). The loss function minimized contrastive energy regularized with VICReg \cite{Bardes2022} (variance weight=1.0, invariance weight=1.0, covariance weight=0.04). Training used Adam optimizer (learning rate $1 \times 10^{-4}$, batch size~16, 100 epochs). Inference latency averaged 189\,ms per patient.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

The primary outcome was concordance with the gold-standard FRENCH triage level, assessed using weighted Cohen's $\kappa$ (quadratic weights), Spearman correlation, F1-scores (micro and macro), AUC-ROC (one-vs-rest, DeLong CIs), MAE, and RMSE. A composite Z-score integrated these metrics:

\begin{equation}
\text{Score} = Z(-\text{MAE}) + Z(-\text{RMSE}) + Z(\kappa_w) + Z(r_s)
\label{eq:zscore}
\end{equation}

Secondary outcomes included multiclass Brier scores, calibration analysis, GEMSA prediction, and performance by input data type (structured vs.\ unstructured).

\section{Part 2: Prospective Simulation Framework (EIMLIA-TEU)}

\subsection{Study Design}

The simulation constitutes a \textbf{prospective simulation with retrospective validation}, combining the rigor of retrospective methodology (real data, bias control) with prospective projection (future scenarios, stress tests).

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Simulation framework design characteristics}
\label{tab:sim_design}
\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Value} \\
\midrule

DES platform & SimPy \\
MAS platform & Mesa \\
Process mining & PM4Py \\
Regulatory compliance & CPP exemption (MR-004) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Data Source}

The dataset comes from the institutional data warehouse of CHU Lille, comprising clinical variables (nursing verbatims, time-stamped vital signs, ICD-10 diagnoses, IGS~II scores), temporal variables (precise ISO~8601 timestamps), and resource variables (laboratory tests, imaging, specialist consultations).

Inclusion criteria: adult patients ($\geq 18$ years) with complete documented visits, archived FRENCH triage, nursing verbatim $\geq 10$ words, and complete vital signs. Exclusion criteria: minors, administrative visits without medical acts, critical missing data ($> 30\,\%$), direct inter-hospital transfers, and readmissions within 24\,h.

\subsection{Hybrid DES-MAS Architecture}

\subsubsection{DES Component (SimPy)}

The model topology comprises 17 treatment stations modeling the complete patient pathway: arrival, administrative registration, nurse triage, waiting room, consultation boxes (4 types), complementary examinations (4 types), specialist consultations, short-stay unit, resuscitation room, orientation decision, and discharge. Temporal parameters are calibrated on observed distributions via process mining (Inductive Miner, fitness $> 0.95$), with non-homogeneous Poisson arrivals ($\lambda(h)$ varying from 2.1 to 12.8 patients/h).

\subsubsection{MAS Component (Mesa)}

The MAS layer defines 8 patient behavioral archetypes: compliant (55\,\%), anxious (15\,\%), uncontrolled pain (12\,\%), confused/disoriented (8\,\%), verbally aggressive (4\,\%), language barrier (3\,\%), complex polymorbid (2\,\%), and premature departure (1\,\%). Resource agents model triage nurses (2--4), box nurses (8--12), emergency physicians (6--10), CT scanners (2), radiography rooms (3), short-stay beds (12), and consultation boxes (40).

\subsection{Digital Twins}

Four-dimensional digital twins ensure faithful representation: structural (2,400\,m$^2$ floor plan, equipment geolocation, inter-station distance matrix), behavioral (15 decision trees from process mining, logistic regression prescription models), temporal (non-homogeneous Poisson arrival model with weekly and monthly seasonality), and technical (GPU load profile, AI infrastructure M/M/c simulation, realistic fault injection).

\subsection{Simulation Scenarios}

Five scenarios are defined: S1~(manual triage baseline, 182 patients/24h), S2a/b/c~(each AI architecture individually under normal load, 85\,\% acceptance rate, 48h stress tests), and S3~(health crisis at 200\,\% load with hybrid LLM-JEPA architecture and weekly critical failure injection).

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}

For the primary criterion ($H_0: \kappa = 0.65$ vs.\ $H_1: \kappa = 0.80$, $\alpha = 0.05$ bilateral, power $1-\beta = 0.90$), the required sample size is $n = 1,100$ per scenario (Donner \& Eliasziw method). The simulation generates 100,000 patients per scenario, ensuring power $> 99\,\%$. Comparative analyses use weighted $\kappa$ with bootstrap CIs (10,000 replications), Z-test with Bonferroni correction ($\alpha' = 0.0083$), repeated measures ANOVA, and DeLong tests for ROC comparison.

\chapter{Proposed Solution: Systemic Modeling with SysML}
\label{chap:solution}

This chapter presents the SysML-based systemic modeling that formalizes the AI-assisted triage system architecture, bridging clinical requirements and technical implementation.

\section{Justification of the SysML Approach}

\begin{definition}[Model-Based Systems Engineering]
MBSE is a formalized approach supporting requirements, design, analysis, and verification throughout a system's lifecycle, using models as primary artifacts rather than textual documents.
\end{definition}

The integration of an AI system into an ED constitutes a systems engineering challenge characterized by multiple stakeholders with potentially divergent objectives, strict real-time constraints, regulatory requirements (GDPR, European AI Act), and complex human-machine interactions in a critical context. SysML modeling formalizes these dimensions before the simulation phase, reducing omission risks and facilitating validation by clinical experts.

\section{Summary of Systemic Modeling}

The SysML modeling formalizes the AI-assisted triage system across four complementary perspectives: requirements (traceable functional and non-functional needs), structural (hierarchical system decomposition), behavioral (workflow and human-machine interaction modeling), and parametric (quantitative constraint formalization). This MBSE approach serves as a methodological bridge between clinical requirements and technical implementation, reducing the research-clinical disconnect identified in the literature.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% CHAPTER 6: EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\chapter{Experimental Results}
\label{chap:results}

This chapter presents the results from the TIAEU proof-of-concept study, providing the empirical foundation upon which the simulation framework is built.

\section{Population Characteristics}

During the inclusion period, 73,236 patients visited Roger Salengro Hospital's ED. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 657 patients (0.90\,\%) were retained for analysis. The mean age was 42.6 years (SD~19.7, median~38). The sample was gender-balanced (50.2\,\% male). Most admissions occurred during morning hours (36.7\,\%, 06:00--14:00). The primary chief complaints were trauma (19.3\,\%), abdominal (15.5\,\%), and cardiovascular (13.1\,\%). A quarter of patients (24.5\,\%) had comorbidities, predominantly cardiovascular. Most patients were triaged as FRENCH 3B (53.9\,\%), with sparse representation in the highest acuity categories (class~1: $n=4$, 0.6\,\%).

\section{Training Performance and Overfitting}

Over 100 training epochs, TRIAGEMASTER achieved a training accuracy plateau of approximately 75\,\%, with validation accuracy similarly stable at 72\,\%, indicating reasonable generalization. URGENTIAPARSE exhibited severe overfitting: perfect training accuracy (1.0) by epoch~20 but persistently poor validation accuracy ($\sim$0.5), indicating memorization rather than generalizable learning. EMERGINET reached 0.85 training accuracy but 0.60 validation accuracy, indicating moderate overfitting.

\section{Primary Analysis: FRENCH Triage Prediction}

Table~\ref{tab:primary_results} presents the main comparative results.

EMERGINET & 0.401 & 0.979 & 0.560 & 0.602 & 0.731 & 0.747 & 0.820 & 0.860 & 0.438 & 0.686 \\
TRIAGEMASTER & 0.637 & 1.180 & 0.370 & 0.005 & 0.618 & 0.613 & 0.554 & 0.696 & $-$3.511 & 0.642 \\
Nurse triage & 1.393 & 1.834 & 0.080 & 0.024 & 0.303 & 0.275 & 0.303 & 0.498 & $-$4.343 & 0.776 \\

All $\kappa_w$ values $P < .001$ except nurse triage ($P = .08$). All Spearman values $P < .001$ except TRIAGEMASTER ($P = .95$) and nurse triage ($P = .76$).}
\end{table}

URGENTIAPARSE (LLM) achieved the highest composite score (2.514), with F1-micro of 0.900 (95\,\% CI 0.876--0.924), AUC-ROC of 0.879 (95\,\% CI 0.851--0.907), and weighted $\kappa$ of 0.800 ($P < .001$, 95\,\% CI 0.761--0.839). Exact agreement reached 90.0\,\%, with near agreement ($\pm$1 level) of 92.8\,\%. Error metrics showed an MAE of 0.228 (approximately one triage level error every 4--5 patients).

EMERGINET (JEPA) achieved moderate performance (F1-micro$=$0.731, AUC$=$0.686, $\kappa_w = 0.560$), while TRIAGEMASTER (NLP) performed poorly (F1-micro$=$0.618, AUC$=$0.642). Current nurse triage showed the lowest performance against the gold standard ($\kappa_w = 0.080$, $P = .08$; exact agreement$=$30.3\,\%), reflecting the gap between real-time clinical judgment under pressure and the retrospective expert consensus standard.

\section{Error Pattern Analysis}

Confusion matrix analysis revealed distinct error patterns. URGENTIAPARSE and EMERGINET slightly overestimated acuity for lower triage levels, indicating a clinically conservative bias that favors patient safety. TRIAGEMASTER systematically underestimated acuity. Nurse triage showed scattered and inconsistent patterns.

Bland-Altman analysis confirmed low, well-centered errors for URGENTIAPARSE (mean difference $-0.02$, 95\,\% limits of agreement $-1.58$ to 1.54) and moderate errors for EMERGINET (mean difference 0.08, limits $-2.05$ to 2.21). TRIAGEMASTER showed larger deviations (limits $-3.02$ to 2.98).

For undertriage risk assessment, URGENTIAPARSE showed an undertriage rate of 4.6\,\% and an overtriage rate of 5.4\,\%. For high-acuity classes (1--2, $n=90$), URGENTIAPARSE achieved sensitivity of 87.8\,\% (95\,\% CI 79.2--93.7\,\%) and specificity of 95.1\,\% (95\,\% CI 91.3--97.6\,\%).

\section{Calibration and Reliability}

Multiclass Brier scores indicated superior probabilistic calibration for URGENTIAPARSE (0.142) compared with EMERGINET (0.385), TRIAGEMASTER (0.524), and nurse triage (0.693). However, calibration analysis revealed heterogeneous class-specific reliability: Class~1 predictions were overconfident due to extreme sparsity; Class~2 was dominated by high-probability predictions; Class~3 showed partial calibration; and Class~4 displayed the most balanced calibration.

\section{Secondary Analysis: GEMSA Prediction}

URGENTIAPARSE substantially outperformed other models in predicting patient disposition (GEMSA), achieving a composite Z-score of 2.473 (Table~\ref{tab:gemsa_results}).

\begin{table}[H]

\midrule
URGENTIAPARSE & 0.082 & 0.402 & 0.863 & 0.864 & 0.957 & 0.628 & 0.957 & 0.960 & \textbf{2.473} \\
TRIAGEMASTER & 0.364 & 0.863 & 0.185 & 0.240 & 0.811 & 0.198 & 0.811 & 0.840 & $-$2.056 \\
EMERGINET & 0.988 & 1.009 & 0.000 & 0.000 & 0.027 & 0.009 & 0.027 & 0.985 & $-$4.399 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

URGENTIAPARSE achieved an MAE of 0.082, weighted $\kappa$ of 0.863, Spearman of 0.864, and F1-micro of 0.957, with 95.7\,\% exact agreement, confirming its accuracy for disposition prediction.

\label{tab:data_modality}
\begin{tabular}{@{}llccccccc@{}}

\midrule
URGENTIAPARSE & Struct. & 0.213 & 0.748 & 0.821 & 0.903 & 0.898 & 0.928 & 1.806 \\
URGENTIAPARSE & Unstruct. & 0.240 & 0.807 & 0.790 & 0.893 & 0.891 & 0.924 & 1.628 \\
EMERGINET & Unstruct. & 0.516 & 1.240 & 0.430 & 0.791 & 0.539 & 0.843 & $-$0.993 \\
EMERGINET & Struct. & 0.510 & 1.247 & 0.420 & 0.807 & 0.551 & 0.836 & $-$1.357 \\
TRIAGEMASTER & Struct. & 0.916 & 1.557 & 0.057 & 0.572 & 0.190 & 0.712 & $-$4.790 \\
TRIAGEMASTER & Unstruct. & 0.991 & 1.629 & $-$0.003 & 0.545 & 0.118 & 0.691 & $-$4.949 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Structured data yielded slightly better performance than unstructured transcripts for URGENTIAPARSE (Z-score 1.806 vs.\ 1.628) and TRIAGEMASTER ($-4.790$ vs.\ $-4.949$), while EMERGINET showed minimal difference. The relatively small performance gap for URGENTIAPARSE between modalities suggests that the LLM captures clinically relevant information from both sources, supporting the feasibility of voice-based triage assistance.

\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chap:discussion}

\section{Principal Findings}

The TIAEU proof-of-concept demonstrated that the LLM-based architecture (URGENTIAPARSE) achieved superior performance across multiple metrics compared with JEPA (EMERGINET), NLP (TRIAGEMASTER), and current nurse triage. The composite Z-score of 2.514, F1-micro of 0.900, and AUC-ROC of 0.879 represent substantial improvements over prior French ED triage models: Clinical BELGPT-2 achieved F1 of 0.62 \cite{GuerraAdames2025}, and the original FRENCH scale validation reported AUC of 0.83--0.86 \cite{Taboulet2009, Taboulet2019}.

The strong performance of URGENTIAPARSE on both structured and unstructured data (Z-scores of 1.806 and 1.628, respectively) supports the feasibility of multimodal triage assistance. Its conservative error pattern (4.6\,\% undertriage vs.\ 5.4\,\% overtriage) aligns with patient safety priorities.

\section{Comparison with Prior Work}

Our findings extend previous research in several ways. First, we provide the first systematic comparison of three distinct AI paradigms (NLP, LLM, JEPA) under consistent conditions using the FRENCH scale. Second, the inclusion of real nurse-patient audio data rather than synthetic or retrospective text provides a more ecologically valid evaluation. Third, the URGENTIAPARSE AUC of 0.879 surpasses previous FRENCH scale validation studies conducted with nurses.

However, the severe overfitting observed for URGENTIAPARSE (perfect training accuracy of 1.0 with validation accuracy of approximately 0.5) raises fundamental concerns about generalizability. This likely reflects the extremely small effective sample size relative to model complexity (657 cases for the 137M-parameter FlauBERT base).

\section{Limitations of the Proof-of-Concept}

\subsection{Selection Bias}

The extreme selection bias represents perhaps the most critical limitation. Only 657 of 73,236 patients (0.9\,\%) had usable recordings, limited to volunteer nurses during feasible moments, likely excluding the highest-acuity cases, chaotic shifts, and patients with communication difficulties. The included cohort had slightly lower acuity than the broader ED population ($P = .02$).

\subsection{Sparse High-Acuity Representation}

Class~1 included only 4 patients, Class~2 included 86 (13.1\,\%), and no Class~3A or Class~6 cases were observed. This severely limits training on high-risk cases where undertriage has the greatest consequences, and makes reliable performance estimation for rare but critical categories impossible.

\subsection{Overfitting}

URGENTIAPARSE's severe overfitting (perfect training accuracy with poor validation performance) clearly indicates memorization rather than learning of generalizable triage patterns. This overfitting persisted despite dropout, L2 regularization, and early stopping, suggesting that the effective sample size is insufficient for the model complexity.

\subsection{Monocentric Design}

Results from a single French academic tertiary care hospital may not generalize to community hospitals, rural EDs, non-French healthcare systems, or culturally and linguistically distinct populations.

\section{Limitations of the Simulation Framework}

\subsection{Ecological Fidelity}

Despite calibration efforts, simulation cannot capture all emergent interactions of a real system. Adaptive human behaviors (improvisation, informal negotiations) are only partially modeled \cite{Fishwick2007}. The 8 patient archetypes and 4 physician profiles constitute simplifications of real behavioral diversity.

\subsection{Gold Standard Validation}

The 5-expert panel, while statistically robust, may present systematic biases linked to local triage culture. The initial inter-rater agreement ($\kappa = 0.72$) indicates substantial but imperfect consensus.

\subsection{Economic Uncertainties}

TCO estimates carry significant uncertainty ($\pm$30\,\%), the 3-year ROI horizon does not capture long-term costs (technological obsolescence, major updates), and change management costs are difficult to estimate a priori.

\subsection{Ethical Considerations}

Potential algorithmic biases related to representation (ethnic minorities, non-French-speaking patients), linguistic patterns (informal language, regionalisms), and socioeconomic factors remain unquantified. Professional resistance, medico-legal responsibility allocation, and technological dependency risks require careful assessment before deployment.

\section{From Proof-of-Concept to Simulation}

The proof-of-concept results provide the empirical foundation for the simulation framework. The observed model performances, error patterns, and latency profiles are integrated as parameters in the DES-MAS simulation, enabling realistic projection of system-level impacts under varied operational conditions. The SysML modeling ensures traceability between clinical requirements and simulation parameters, while the digital twin architecture enables calibrated stress-testing that is impossible to conduct in a live clinical environment.

\section{Evaluation Criteria and Targets}

Table~\ref{tab:evaluation_targets} synthesizes the secondary evaluation criteria and performance targets for the simulation framework.

\chapter{Conclusion and Perspectives}
\label{chap:conclusion}

\section{Summary of Contributions}

This dissertation presents a comprehensive evaluation framework for AI-assisted emergency triage, comprising three main contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Proof-of-concept study (TIAEU):} Development and comparative evaluation of three AI architectures (NLP, LLM, JEPA) using real nurse-patient interaction data from 657 patients at CHU Lille. The LLM-based URGENTIAPARSE achieved the highest accuracy (F1-micro~0.900, AUC~0.879, $\kappa_w = 0.800$), outperforming traditional NLP, JEPA, and current nurse triage practices. These results, published at BDCAT'25 \cite{Lansiaux2025bdcat} and submitted as a full journal article \cite{Lansiaux2025jmir}, provide the first systematic comparison of three distinct AI paradigms under consistent conditions using the FRENCH triage scale.
    
    \item \textbf{Prospective simulation framework (EIMLIA-TEU):} Design of a hybrid DES-MAS architecture enriched with digital twins, calibrated on 459,259 patients, with five simulation scenarios including crisis conditions and stress tests. This framework enables multidimensional pre-clinical evaluation across clinical, organizational, economic, and technical criteria.
    
    \item \textbf{SysML systemic modeling:} Formalization of the AI-assisted triage system through requirements, structural, behavioral, and parametric diagrams, bridging clinical requirements and technical implementation while ensuring traceability.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Key Findings and Clinical Implications}

The proof-of-concept demonstrates that LLM-based triage prediction can achieve high accuracy, with URGENTIAPARSE exhibiting a conservative error pattern favoring patient safety (4.6\,\% undertriage vs.\ 5.4\,\% overtriage). However, critical barriers to clinical deployment must be addressed: severe overfitting necessitating larger datasets (target $>$10,000 cases), extreme selection bias requiring systematic recording protocols, sparse high-acuity representation demanding targeted data collection, and monocentric design requiring multicenter validation.

\section{Perspectives}

\subsection{Short-Term (3--12 Months)}

Finalization of simulations and results analysis; gold standard validation by expert panel; algorithmic bias audits and subgroup analyses; economic analysis; and publication of simulation results.

\subsection{Medium-Term (2--3 Years)}

Prospective pilot study in real clinical conditions; multicenter validation extension; ergonomic clinical interface development; professional acceptability evaluation; and comprehensive overfitting mitigation through parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA, adapters), aggressive data augmentation, and ensemble methods.

\subsection{Long-Term (3--5 Years)}

Large-scale deployment with medico-economic evaluation; extension to pediatric emergencies; integration of additional modalities (imaging, ECG); contribution to standardization of medical AI evaluation; and development of continual learning infrastructure with concept drift detection.

\section{Closing Statement}

The integration of AI into the emergency triage process represents a significant opportunity to improve care quality and efficiency. However, this integration requires rigorous evaluation extending beyond isolated predictive performance metrics. The methodology proposed in this dissertation---combining a retrospective proof-of-concept with prospective multimodal simulation, systemic SysML modeling, and multidimensional evaluation---provides a reference framework for the pre-clinical assessment of digital health innovations. The proof-of-concept results establish technical feasibility and identify the most promising architecture, while the simulation framework provides the tools to bridge the substantial gap between proof-of-concept evidence and safe clinical deployment.
